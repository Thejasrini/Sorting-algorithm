# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A simple and interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project helps in understanding how different sorting algorithms work through **numbers-only visualization**.

---

## Project Description

Sorting algorithms are an important part of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
This application visually demonstrates the sorting process by showing comparisons, swaps, and the final sorted output step by step.

The project is designed to be clean, easy to use, and educational.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Merge Sort
